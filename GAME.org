* Game:

** Data-driven tile-based MMORPG
** Minimalistic graphics (could be n-curses)
** Plenty of text
** Huge complexity in a transparent way to the user 
** Data-driven & scripted logic
** Client-Server architecture
** Multi-platform (PC-mobile)

* Features:
  
** Huge base-map. For instance, it could be automatically generated with a openstreetmap database.
** Within the base-map, procedurally generated content. 
** Allows for power-users to generate their own world/adventure.
  
* What's the novely? brainstorming
  
** Customised relatively-short games (one month?)
** Two factions
** Players need to organise themselves to succeed. Social component.
** More conversational/text elements. Menus. Text descriptions.
** Arcade elements? nah
** PC: Move right click, action left click, and keyboard. 
** Tablet. click, drag, hold.
** Entity-Action data-base design
** Whenever user clicks on item, character "thinks" with a booble with all the possible actions (text-based) given by the dataset
** Descriptions also work with a text booble and hyperlinks (to find a drawer in a desk)
** Game elements:

******* NOT ORIGINAL
*** Exploration/gathering
*** Sandbox elements (farming, fishing, crafting)
*** RPG: Leveling-up, quests
 
******* ORIGINAL?
*** Text based stuff / hyperlinks
*** Post-apocalyptic / two factions
*** Arcade elements: double rolling, bullet hell

*** FOCUS ON: Platform for story-telling-RPG-etc... Mechanics stay, but content can be changed through python. Focus on having good general mechanics: text/menus/click/move/tiles/etc...
*** People can submit their adventures, quests characters or items. For instance, somebody could implement a dog with its graphics and AI behavior. 
*** Offial server maintains main MMO story (Isle of Man)
*** Users are welcome to submit sub-quests or create their own full servers
*** All logic can be implemented by means of dataset entries + python scripts (plenty of examples allow for easy replication)
*** Can be even a way of learning python/sql
*** Supported front-ends in principle should be both text-based and 3D (rotmg style)
*** Graphics can also be added through the database (add util for graphic creation)
*** I think this would be the most interesting thing. Steam could hold the official server game. Accept donations.

******* ORIGINAL THINGS IN MECHANICS
*** Inter-action with entities with thought-boobles
*** 

*** Characters with a sub-set of skills
*** Interaction with NPCS?: text question-answer
*** Movemenet? right click follows direction., centered on screen
*** Combat? Attack and wait. 
***

* Story:

** Defend community against hordes (radioactive/post-apocalyptic)
** Two (good vs. evil) communities (The Stand - Isle of man)
** Gather scarce resources from waste-lands (meds, oil, food, weapons)

* Minimal possible set-up

** Data driven (SQL + scripts)
** MMORPG
** Minimalistic (RotMG)
